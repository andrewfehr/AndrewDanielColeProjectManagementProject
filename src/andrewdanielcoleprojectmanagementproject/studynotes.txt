A System is: A combination of software and hardware that provides a solution for a business problem

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): splits the software development process into multiple steps
It allows the developers to outline each task required to build a software application and plan out how they will design, test, and maintain that application

One model of the software development life cycle is the waterfall model, developed by Dr Winston Royce in 1970
The waterfall method consists of the following steps:
Analysis
Design
Implementation
Testing
Deployment
Maintenance

If mistakes are found, it is least costly to fix them in the analysis phase and most costly in the maintenance phase
The SDLC process helps to plan out software fully and find bugs before the maintenance phase

Some examples of project management tools include: Gantt charts, Unified Modeling Language (UML), daily logs, and weekly reports

The Gantt Chart is a chart that lays out and tracks the progress of projects
It was designed by Henry Gantt in the 1910s

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a tool to visualize specific parts of a system
It can be easier to describe and design complex software through UML than in writing
